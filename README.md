# WIP: InfinitySwap Widgets

The @infinityswap/widgets package [coming soon] is an npm package of React components used to provide subsets of the InfinitySwap Protocol functionality in a small and configurable user interface element.

# Swap Widget

The Swap Widget bundles the whole swapping experience into a single React component that developers can easily embed in their app with a few lines of code.

You can customize the theme (colors, fonts, and more) to match the style of your application.
